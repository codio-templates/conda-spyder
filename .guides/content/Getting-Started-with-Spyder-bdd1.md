The layout for this page is set up to auto-open Spyder. Click **Edit** and then the **Layout** button to see the set up.

If you closed Spyder and you need to reopen it, the easiest way to do it is by restarting the box in `Project` > `Restart Box...`.

If you want to use Spyder in full screen, you can use the button `Virtual Desktop` in the top navigation menu.

Continue with the next pages if you need help setting up your own stack or if you need to make changes to the Spyder installation.
